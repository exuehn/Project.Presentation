# Not What You Think Of

A website looking game that you will not know how it is going to turn out.

# Theme  

Defamiliarisation
We have been relying on tools and shortcuts to easily access interfaces. 
Already the muscle memory embeded whenever we interact with an interface.
How we know we can use the mouse to direct ourselves through a website, using the keyboard to input information, copying and pasting using CTRL+C and CTRL+V.
Going to explore how we can change the norm of interacting an interface.

Power and Control
Website designers always have the power to lead you to do what they want you to.
For example, they would emphasise the 'BUY NOW' button so that you'll unconsiously willing to press on the highlighted button.
Now that I can code and control what the users are able to access and use, I want to mess up what the users would normally do or to make the website not make sense.

# Mechanics  

There will be a simple website, where users are able to interact with it.
There will be a few tasks or levels where you have to complete under the difficult circumstances they are in.
This could be working with an inverted mouse, keyboard keys are messed up, cursor constantly changing positions.

# Aims  

Main objective is to make the user uncomfortable when dealing with the website.
To feel like using an interface is foreign and difficult.
Knowing that we are so used to what we are using, and question why are interfaces build the 'normal' way that we all use.
Remembering how we felt when we first accessed technology and interfaces where we had to adjust the way we think or move.

# Aesthetics

It would look very 1990s, old webpage designs.
Very old school vibes, bright colours that doesn't go well together.
